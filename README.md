The Pharmacy Management system is a project in which there are 3 types of users(Seller, Admin and the Buyer) where the pharmacy can be admin, customers can be buyer and the people who sell medicines to the pharmacies can log on to the seller section.This makes the pharmacy more accessible from the comfort of home for buyer and similarly for the pharmacy(Admin) to buy the medicines from the seller directly. This also makes it is easy for the pharmacy to note the medicines bought and sold virtually. The seller can also just upload their stock , so that the pharmacy(Admin) can buy the medicine they desire to buy.
